# My Little Raytracer

## Overview
My Little Raytracer is a simple yet effective ray tracing engine that renders 3D scenes using fundamental ray tracing techniques. It is designed for learning purposes and serves as a foundation for further exploration into graphics programming.

## Features
* Basic ray-sphere intersection
* In-app realtime scene viewer

## Requirements
* A compiler supporting C++17 or later
* Optional: Image viewer to visualize rendered scene images

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone --recursive https://https://github.com/ViktorPopp/MyLittleRaytracer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd MyLittleRaytracer
    ```
3. Generate project files (Windows):
    ```sh
    cd scripts && Setup.bat && cd ..
    ```
4. Now open the project generated by Premake5 in your IDE or build it for your platform
